##  Learning Modules (Structured & Educational)

### **Cryptography Basics** *(Part of Cyber Security 101 Path)*
- Covers symmetric encryption, hashing functions, and the use of John the Ripper.
- Serves as a smooth introduction to cryptographic primitives and concepts.  
:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### **Public Key Cryptography Basics** *(Part of Cyber Security 101 Path)*
- Introduces RSA, Diffie-Hellman, SSH, SSL/TLS, PGP/GPG in a CTF-style lab environment.  
:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### **Hashing – Crypto 101**
- (Premium) Focuses on hashing algorithms, integrity checking, password cracking.
- Hands-on guided lab—great if you have subscriber access.  
:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### **Cryptographic Failures**
- Explores real-world crypto vulnerabilities: ECB and padding oracles, insecure randomness, length-extension attacks.
- Rich hands-on module for understanding practical attack vectors.

##  Challenge Rooms (Standalone, CTF-style)

### **Crypto Failures**
- Combines challenge-style exploitation with encryption mistakes.
- You’ll break a flawed homemade encryption scheme, recover a key, and capture flags.

###  Recommendations

- **For structured learning** → Start with the **Cryptography Basics** or **Public Key Cryptography Basics** modules.
- **To study real attacks** → Dive into **Cryptographic Failures**.
- **For hands-on exploitation** → Tackle the **Crypto Failures** room to see crypto mistakes exploited CTF-style.
