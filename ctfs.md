# Cryptography-Focused CTF Platforms and Games

If you want to practice or research **cryptography-only CTF challenges**, here are some great platforms:

---

## üéØ Crypto-Focused CTF Platforms

### 1. [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/)
- Entirely cryptography-based challenges.  
- Covers: classical ciphers, RSA, ECC, lattice problems, side-channels, block ciphers.  
- Progressive difficulty, from beginner to advanced math-heavy problems.  
- Probably the **best single resource** for crypto-only CTFs.  

---

### 2. [MysteryTwister C3 (MTC3)](https://www.mysterytwisterc3.org/en/)
- Longstanding platform for crypto puzzles.  
- Ranges from simple substitution ciphers to advanced modern crypto attacks.  
- Very educational, with community discussions on solutions.  

---

### 3. [OverTheWire ‚Äì Krypton](https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/)
- A beginner-friendly wargame focused specifically on cryptography basics.  
- Walks through classical ciphers ‚Üí modern crypto mistakes.  
- Good for early-stage learners.  

---

### 4. [Cryptopals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)
- A legendary set of ~60 challenges.  
- Each teaches a core concept in applied cryptography (AES modes, padding oracles, stream ciphers, MAC forgery, Diffie-Hellman).  
- Not gamified like a scoreboard, but widely respected and referenced in academia/industry.  

---

### 5. [picoCTF (Crypto category)](https://play.picoctf.org/)
- Thousands of public problems across categories.  
- Crypto is one of the main areas, highlighting **common pitfalls** (bad randomness, weak RSA, XOR).

## üïπ Other Crypto Puzzle/Challenge Sites
- **[HackTheBox Challenges ‚Äì Crypto](https://www.hackthebox.com/)** ‚Äì Paid platform, but with a dedicated crypto section.  
- **[Ringzer0Team Online CTF](https://ringzer0ctf.com/)** ‚Äì A mix of categories, but heavy on crypto/math puzzles.  
- **[Root Me ‚Äì Cryptanalysis](https://www.root-me.org/)** ‚Äì Classical and modern cryptography challenges.  

---

## üìå Best for Research
- **CryptoHack, picoCTF, and CTFtime writeups** ‚Üí Richest dataset for systematic analysis.  
- **Cryptopals** ‚Üí Serves as a ‚Äúcurriculum‚Äù benchmark for applied cryptography.  
- **MysteryTwister** ‚Üí Connects with broader crypto puzzle community outside CTFs.
