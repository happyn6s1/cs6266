# Research Project Ideas: Cryptography in CTF Contests

You are considering a research paper/project for your cybersecurity master’s degree, with a focus on **cryptography challenges in Capture the Flag (CTF) contests**.  
Here are some potential directions and topics:

---

## 🔑 1. Systematic Analysis of CTF Cryptography Challenges
- Collect a dataset of crypto-related CTF challenges from popular platforms (CTFtime, picoCTF, Google CTF, DEF CON CTF, etc.).
- Categorize them: classical ciphers, RSA/elliptic curve weaknesses, side-channel simulations, lattice-based, custom schemes, etc.
- Identify trends: which cryptographic mistakes are most common? How has this evolved over the last 5–10 years?
- **Paper angle:** *“Trends and Taxonomies of Cryptographic Vulnerabilities in CTF Competitions”*.

---

## 🔐 2. Educational Value of CTF Crypto
- Study how well CTF crypto challenges align with real-world crypto vulnerabilities.
- Compare CTF challenge crypto mistakes (e.g., reusing nonces in AES-GCM, small exponents in RSA, padding oracle flaws) with real-world CVEs and incidents.
- **Paper angle:** *“From CTFs to the Wild: How CTF Cryptography Challenges Reflect Real-World Security Pitfalls”*.

---

## ⚡ 3. Automating CTF Crypto Solves
- Build or evaluate tools that can automatically recognize and solve certain classes of crypto CTF problems (e.g., weak RSA, lattice reductions, XOR streams, frequency analysis).
- Compare performance with human solvers.
- **Paper angle:** *“Towards Automated Solvers for Cryptographic Challenges in CTF Competitions”*.  

---

## 🧩 4. Custom Cryptography in CTFs
- Many CTF challenges invent "homebrew crypto" schemes.
- Analyze a large set of them and study *how people typically break them* (e.g., linear algebra leaks, poor randomness, modular arithmetic mistakes).
- Contribute guidelines for designing better “teaching challenges.”
- **Paper angle:** *“Breaking the Homebrew: A Survey of Non-Standard Cryptographic Challenges in CTFs”*.  

---

## 🌐 5. Post-Quantum Cryptography in CTFs
- Investigate whether and how post-quantum crypto (lattice-based, isogeny-based, code-based) has appeared in CTF challenges.
- Explore what vulnerabilities designers commonly introduce when making these challenges.
- **Paper angle:** *“CTF Crypto Challenges in the Post-Quantum Era: Trends, Pitfalls, and Lessons”*.

---

## 🛠 6. CTF Challenges as Teaching Tools
- Run a study (with classmates or undergrads) where you measure the learning outcomes of participants who solve cryptography challenges.
- Do they understand real crypto better afterwards?
- **Paper angle:** *“Gamified Learning: Measuring the Educational Effectiveness of Cryptography CTF Challenges”*.  

---

## 🚀 7. Novel Challenge Design
- Propose and design your own cryptography CTF challenges based on *real but underexplored* crypto issues (e.g., misuse of threshold signatures, blockchain-related cryptography, or multi-party computation).
- Evaluate how participants perform.
- **Paper angle:** *“Design and Evaluation of Novel Cryptography Challenges for CTF Competitions”*.

## ✅ Choosing a Direction
- If you want something more **practical and tool-based**, focus on (3) *Automating crypto solves* or (7) *Designing novel challenges*.  
- If you want something more **survey/academic**, focus on (1), (2), or (4).
